In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. I'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. While building this credit card predictor, I tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as scaling, label encoding, and missing value imputation. I finished with some machine learning to predict if a person's application for a credit card would get approved or not given some information about that person.
